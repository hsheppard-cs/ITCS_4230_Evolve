The player must reach the opposite end of the map, where there are two portals for Ev to climb through. Jumping through either portal wins the game!
The player must maneuver through hazards such as gas clouds, enemies, spikes, heights, and obstacles.
There are gold powerups spawned throughout the map, as Ev (playable character) collects a total of 4 powerups, he will evolve from the state of a blob to a frog.
